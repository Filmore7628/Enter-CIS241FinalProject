	<p> My interests were walking again and getting stronger.<br>Then the pandemic happened, and I could not go anywhere.<br>I had friends and family were diagnosed with COVID. My interests changed.</p>

	<p>What are the local rules?</p>

	<p>What are the state rules?</p>
	<p> We had our food delivered from various places to limit our exposure.</p>

	<p>My sister died, and we had to travel. I had to know what the rules were in the county I was traveling to.  </p>
	<p>Then one month later, my wifeâ€™s grandmother passed, and now we need to know the rules fortraveling and the rules for the state and county of our destination. </p>
