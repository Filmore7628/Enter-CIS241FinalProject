<p> CIS 241 F20 1520 - WEB DEVELOPMENT <br> 
This class was all new to me, and as I progressed, it started to make sense. I learned HTML5 and how it became the standard for people with disabilities, and how many organizations support the movement online. The steps to web pages such as HTML5 and then there is CSS to work with HTML5 and there are host of other languages to do so much inside HTML5.

 <p> CIS 250 - Database Theory and Design <br>
I thought Access was the start. I was mistaken, and this class cleared that up for me. Primarily since we used the Access software to learn more. I did not know databases were the medium of choice. To understand it, you need to learn the language.

<p> CIS 251 - Structured Query Language (SQL) <br>
I learned a lot about Structured Query Language and Amazon Web Services. The class is two classes in one, and the preparation is necessary because you also know how to use a virtual desktop. You learn all of this on your way to earning two certificates that cannot only put on your resume it can go on any response that you send digitally. If I started naming one software program like Apache, Microsoft SQL Server Manager, MySql workbench, they would seem like buzzwords to those who have not yet taken the class.
