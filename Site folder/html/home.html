<p> I have been able to do many things in my life and in doing so it has made me who I am. </p>
<br><br>
<p>I have been able to help others while learning new skills. As a firefighter, I learned about Hazardous materials. Much of our training was in controlled environments. The real-life responses required a very different approach to have a favorable outcome </p>

<p>I needed to learn more about people I volunteered with the American Red Cross. This opportunity allowed me to deploy to Florida and be a shelter manager for over a few hundred folks. I learned and taught many classes, many different courses as little as four, and as many as 200. The experience expanded who I was as a person.</p>

<p> 
I then became a construction worker who worked at heights on the new Air traffic control tower in Seattle at the Sea-Tac airport. I operated heavy equipment and laid a lot of concrete.

<p>
Finally, I evolved into a safety instructor, which I did not see coming. The jobs I had done previously had taken a toll on my body. I had to learn the hard way. I was a safety instructor for 13 years. Now I start a new chapter in my life.  I will be a Web Application and cloud developer.
